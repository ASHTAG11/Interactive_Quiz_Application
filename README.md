*DESCRIPTION* : The CT Quiz Application is a clean, modern, and user-friendly quiz platform designed to make learning interactive and fun. From the moment users open the app, they are welcomed with smooth animations, a stylish logo, and a simple layout that guides them straight into the quiz without any confusion.

The application starts with a warm welcome page where users can begin the quiz with a single click. Once they enter the quiz, the interface becomes fully dynamic—every question, answer button, and feedback response is generated through JavaScript, making the experience feel lively and responsive.

Each question is displayed one at a time with four options, and the app immediately highlights correct and incorrect answers using clear color changes. This real-time feedback helps users learn quickly. One of the unique touches in your app is the limited refresh feature: users get three chances to refresh a question if they make a mistake. This gives them the opportunity to try again without making the quiz too easy.

Navigation is smooth and intuitive. Users can go to the next question, replay the quiz, or return to the home page at any time. At the end of the quiz, the app shows the user’s score in a clean results screen, along with an option to restart or return home.

With its neat design, animated elements, responsive layout, and smart functional logic, the CT Quiz Application feels polished and well thought out—perfect for students, learners, or anyone who wants a simple and enjoyable quiz experience.
